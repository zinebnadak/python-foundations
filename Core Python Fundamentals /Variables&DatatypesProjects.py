#Unit Converter
#Create a unit conversion program that converts between different units (e.g., meters to kilometers, pounds to kilograms, etc.). This will make use of numbers, input/output, and type conversion

#Interactive Age and Year Calculator
#Build a simple program that calculates how many years a user has lived and can also predict their age in a future year. This makes use of variables, type conversion, input/output, and basic arithmetic.

#Simple Quiz Game
#Create a quiz game that asks the user multiple-choice questions. This will require strings (for questions), numbers (for options), and booleans (for checking correct/incorrect answers). You can also use input/output to display the questions and get answers.

#Simple Voting System
#Build a voting system where users can vote for candidates and check the results at the end. This project will help you work with booleans, numbers, and strings.
