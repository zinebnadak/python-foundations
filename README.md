Python Foundations

Goals

- Reinforce Python fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
- Learn to write clean, reusable, and Pythonic code.
- Build small projects that demonstrate automation, data handling, and basic AI/ML concepts.
- Develop a structured learning path to confidently tackle more advanced topics in Python and beyond.


--------------------- 1. Core Python Fundamentals --------------------- 

- Variables & Data Types
  Practice: numbers, strings, booleans
  Exercise: mini calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with error handling and type hints.

- Logical Conditions
  Script: login simulation with username/password (3 attempts)
  Exercise: nested if/else and logical operators.

- Loops
  Script: FizzBuzz, multiplication tables, factorial calculator
  Exercise: mini text-based game (guess the number).

- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
  Script: inventory system (dictionary) + set operations
  Exercise: count word frequency in a text.

- Error Handling
  Script: wrap above exercises with try/except/finally
  Exercise: handle invalid user input gracefully.

Goal: Solve any beginner Python problem with confidence.

----------- 2. Functions & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) -------------

- Functions
  Practice: recursion, lambda, map/filter/reduce
  Examples: text analyzer, list sorter, prime number generator.

- Classes & Objects
  Script: BankAccount class with methods (deposit, withdraw, transfer) and attributes (account_number, balance)
  Exercise: RPG character class with health, attack, defend

- Mini Project
  Folder: projects/simple_cli_game/
  Small text-based game combining functions and classes

Goal: Write structured, modular code and understand OOP patterns.

---------------------  3. Mini Projects Portfolio --------------------- 

Project 1: Automation
- Folder: projects/automation_scripts/
- Ideas:
  - File organizer: automatically move files based on type
  - PDF/Text/Email parser
  - Web scraper (requests + BeautifulSoup)

Project 2: Data Manipulation
- Folder: projects/data_scripts/
- Ideas:
  - CSV reader/writer
  - Analyze data: max, min, average, duplicates
  - Data visualization with matplotlib or seaborn

Project 3: Mini AI/ML Preparation
- Folder: projects/ml_prep/
- Focus: practice Python for ML
- Ideas:
  - Predict something simple using numpy (linear regression from scratch)
  - Implement K-means clustering on small datasets

How to Use This Repo

- Explore each folder in sequence to follow my learning journey.
- Each folder contains scripts, exercises, and mini-projects.
- Exercises are designed to reinforce core Python concepts and gradually introduce more complex ideas.
- Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are welcome.

Next i will be creating a repo called "Python Practical Projects":
This next repo will focus on applying Python to **real-world tasks and small projects**, including automation, data handling, visualization, and beginner ML/AI applications. 
The goal is to continue building practical skills, create a stronger portfolio, and prepare for more advanced Python work while solving problems that have real-life applications.
By the end of this month, the Python Foundations repo will serve as a strong foundation in Python, providing the confidence and skills to dive into advanced topics in Machine Learning, AI, and Automation.
